	aboutMe:
		'As all the information provided other side of this CV, I just tell what are not mention there, I love to code whenever I found free time (it comes from my love of for the mathematics) from my educational life and my family, as I dream always to be a better developer with learning new something daily from the internet and I’m fond of learning new programming languages and new technologies and new framework. I’m very much interested in UI/UX design in software and mainly web development and some time I also apply my custom thinking to build something new and unique.',
